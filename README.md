# Aedan's Enigma Client

Live app: https://aedan-enigma.now.sh/

Server GitHub: https://github.com/Just-A-Fool/Enigma-Server

## Summary

This app allows a user to learn about and use an Enigma Machine without the difficulty and expense that would come from trying to find and use a real-world counterpart. 

The user can input different settings representing the rotors and plugboard on the real Enigma. These settings can be saved for future use as well. 

The user can encrypt a message in the 'input' text-area and recieve an encrypted version of that message in the 'output' text-area. This message can only be decrypted if the initial settings of the Enigma Machine are known.
